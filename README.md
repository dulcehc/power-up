# Trello Power-Up Template

This is a simple Power-Up to display the coding duration in the card badges.

The time is saved in seconds in the description of the card and then is converted in the correct format.

The cards are created from another application (https://dulcehc.github.io/wakatime-trello/), where the daily time coding is obtained from Wakatime API. If coding activities are more than an hour, a trello card is created.
